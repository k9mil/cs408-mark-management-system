# ðŸ“š Mark Management System [TERZ05]

Mark Management System is a platform that streamlines data aggregation and presentation, aiding exam boards in efficient decision-making. Additionally, the system aims to make the process of uploading marks more enjoyable, by automating some laborious and time-intensive tasks. See below for a non-exhaustive list of features that the system contains.

## Features

- **User Login/Registration System**: A secure authentication system enabling administrators to set up accounts and users to log in with their credentials.
- **Personalised Dashboard**: Each user is provided with a tailored dashboard, with custom cards including information such as student performance metrics which contain data such as the mean, median, mode and pass rate, a list of taught classes, and an overview of classes.
- **Unique Graphs**: On each dashboard, amongst other pages, there are Bar Graphs present which offer unique insights into the performance of students.
- **Data Upload**: Allows the ability to upload student marks for the classes you teach with robust validation to ensure accuracy and integrity of data. Additionally, allows the upload of academic misconduct, or personal circumstances of students.
- **Data Conversion**: Instead of leaving the laborious process of converting files from MyPlace to the Marks Management System format, or from the Marks Management System format to the format Pegasus expects, the system does that for you.
- **Class System**: Allows administrators to create classes, assign lecturers to classes and modify class details. These classes serve as a core part of the application as they are connected to degrees, students and marks.
- **Role System**: Different user roles exist throughout the application, such as administrators and lecturers, each with tailored permissions and controls.
- **Settings**: Customisable settings allow for users of the site to edit their personal details, such as their first name, last name or password.
- **JWT Tokens**: Ensures safety & security by storing key data in JWT tokens which is used as an additional layer of authentication and verification.
- **Modals**: Help and support can be found throughout the page, with a dedicated page with useful information, alongside Modals which contain tips are scattered throughout the system.

and much more, such as individual Student Profiles, Class Profiles and Error Pages!

## Sample Data Generation

This system contains a file inside /backend/scripts, which is called `db_base_values.py`. After setting up the dependencies and going through the installation process outlined below, you can run the file to generate some sample data, including roles, users, classes, students, degrees and some marks.

The system will generate two types of users, an administrator and a lecturer which you can access with these details:

- `admin@mms.com` with the password `12345678`
- `lecturer@mms.com` with the password `12345678`

You may also want to generate some sample marks data for the system, head over to [scripts](https://github.com/k9mil/cs408-mark-management-system/tree/main/mark-management-system/scripts/data_generation) which contains a useful, customisable Data Generation Script written in Python alongside documentation.

## Installation

If you wish to run this web application locally, [Python](https://www.python.org/) will be **necessary** for you to be able to run this system.

1. Clone the repository.

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/k9mil/cs408-mark-management-system.git
   $ cd cs408-mark-management-system
   ```

2. Initialize a virtual environment for packages (ensure that you are in the /backend directory!).

   ```
   [PowerShell]
   > python -m venv venv
   > venv/Scripts/activate

   [Bash]
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies.

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the FastAPI backend.

   ```
   $ python asgi.py
   ```

To run the frontend, you'll need to ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) on your local machine. Assuming the repository has already been cloned, follow the following steps:

1. Install the necessary packages.

   ```
   $ npm i
   ```

2. Run the Vite + React frontend.
   ```
   $ npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

As mentioned before, you can either run the script which generates some default data, or alternatively, you can create an account (and anything else) via the API which can be accessed by either:

- OpenAPI: `/docs`
- ReDoc: `/redoc`

At the moment the system does not support a registration system, so if you want to create an account yourself you will have to use the endpoints (or access the database directly!).

## Documentation

In the backend, a mixture of OpenAPI + ReDoc endpoint documentation and loose [Google Style Comments](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) are used. As mentioned before, OpenAPI can be conveniently accessed by /docs, and ReDoc can be accessed by /redoc, giving you, the user the choice!

For the frontend, a good chunk of the components are from [shadcn/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), therefore no component documentation takes place. However, some functions are commented based on the [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/) standard for additional clarity.

Additionally, each page is recreated inside [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), which not only allows for quick prototyping, but also serves as additional documentation of the entire frontend of the system.

## Demo

If you wish to use the system â€” without going through the trouble of setting it up yourself, feel free to visit the [hosted variant](http://16.171.10.73) of Marks Management System.

The details of the accounts provided earlier also work for the site.
