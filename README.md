## Installation

If you wish to run this web application locally, [Python](https://www.python.org/) will be **necessary** for you to be able to run this system.

1. Clone the repository.
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/k9mil/cs408-mark-management-system.git
   $ cd cs408-mark-management-system
   ```
2. Initialize a virtual environment for packages (ensure that you are in the /backend directory!).
   ```
   [PowerShell]
   > python -m venv venv
   > venv/Scripts/activate

   [Bash]
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the dependencies.
   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the FastAPI backend.
   ```
   $ python asgi.py
   ```
   
To run the frontend, you'll need to ensure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) on your local machine. Assuming the repository has already been cloned, follow the following steps:

1. Install the necessary packages.
   ```
   $ npm i
   ```

2. Run the Vite + React frontend.
   ```
   $ npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

As of right now, a registration system does not exist on the frontend. To be able to use the system, you will have to create the account via an endpoint, which is an unprotected route.

For more information on the API usage, head over to:
- OpenAPI: `/docs`
- ReDoc: `/redoc`

After the account is created, you can login on the frontend and use the system!
