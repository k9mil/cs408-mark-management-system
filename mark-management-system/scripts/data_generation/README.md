# ðŸ“Š Data Generation Script

The code in this subdirectory operates independently of the Mark Management System, while it's made to work alongside of it, as it generates the necessary sample data which can be used to test drive the application, without requiring real user input.

The data generated by the script creates a CSV file (in the directory where the script is ran) in the following format (extracted from a sample run):

```
CLASS_CODE,REG_NO,MARK,STUDENT_FIRSTNAME,STUDENT_LASTNAME,DEGREE_LEVEL,DEGREE,UNIQUE_CODE
CS408,gjr95787,62,Grant,Brown,BSc,Computer Science,CS2020KE
```

## Usage

1. Initialize a virtual environment for packages (yes, a different one to the primary system!).

   ```
   [PowerShell]
   > python -m venv venv
   > venv/Scripts/activate

   [Bash]
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Following that, you can run the application by simply running:

   ```
   python data_generation.py
   ```

By running the data generation script as outlined above, a CSV file will be generated which includes 100 sample rows for the class `CS408`, however, this can be customised by running something in the format of `python data_generation.py CLASS_CODE NUM_STUDENTS`, such as :

```
python data_generation.py CS409 101
```

Which would generate 101 rows, for the class `CS409`. For more information, you can run `python data_generation.py --help` which contains a list of arguments that can be passed in:

```
Usage: data_generation.py [OPTIONS] [CLASS_CODE] [NUM_STUDENTS]

Arguments:
class_code        [CLASS_CODE]    [default: CS408]
num_students      [NUM_STUDENTS]  [default: 100]

Options:
--help          Show this message and exit.
```
