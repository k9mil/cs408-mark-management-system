# ðŸ“Š Data Generation Script

The code in this subdirectory operates independently of the Mark Management System, while it's made to work alongside of it, as it generates the necessary sample data which can be used to test drive the application, without requiring real user input.

The data generated by the script creates a CSV file (in the directory where the script is ran) which represent a real-world file that the lecturer would upload, alongside a set of INSERT statement (displayed in the terminal) which have to be inserted into the databsae prior to the upload of marks. The inserts are necessary due to the fact that marks cannot be uploaded for student which do not exists. The following data is extracted from a sample run:

```
CLASS_CODE,REG_NO,STUDENT_NAME,DEGREE_LEVEL,DEGREE_NAME,MARK,MARK_CODE
CS408,gds21131,Gabriel Weber,BSc (Hons),Computer Science,52,
CS408,xuj58904,Arthur Phillips,BSc (Hons),Computer Science,,EN
```

as well as:

```
INSERT INTO students (reg_no, student_name, year, degree_id) VALUES ('gds21131', 'Gabriel Weber', 1, 1);
INSERT INTO students (reg_no, student_name, year, degree_id) VALUES ('xuj58904', 'Arthur Phillips', 1, 1);
```

## Usage

1. Initialize a virtual environment for packages (yes, a different one to the primary system!).

   ```
   [PowerShell]
   > python -m venv venv
   > venv/Scripts/activate

   [Bash]
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Following that, you can run the application by simply running:

   ```
   python data_generation.py
   ```

By running the data generation script as outlined above, a CSV file will be generated which includes 100 sample rows for the class `CS408`, however, this can be customised by running something in the format of `python data_generation.py CLASS_CODE NUM_STUDENTS`, such as :

```
python data_generation.py CS409 101
```

Which would generate 101 rows, for the class `CS409`. For more information, you can run `python data_generation.py --help` which contains a list of arguments that can be passed in:

```
Usage: data_generation.py [OPTIONS] [CLASS_CODE] [NUM_STUDENTS]

Arguments:
class_code        [CLASS_CODE]    [default: CS408]
num_students      [NUM_STUDENTS]  [default: 100]

Options:
--help          Show this message and exit.
```
