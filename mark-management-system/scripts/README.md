# ðŸ“Š Mark Generation Script

The code in this subdirectory operates independently of the Mark Management System, while it's made to work alongside of it, as it generates the necessary sample data which can be used to test drive the application, without requiring real user input.

The data generated by the script creates a CSV file (in the directory where the script is ran) which represent a real-world file that a lecturer would upload, alongside a set of INSERT statements (displayed in the terminal) which have to be inserted into the database prior to the upload of marks. The inserts are necessary due to the fact that marks cannot be uploaded for student which do not exist. The following data is extracted from a sample run:

```
CLASS_CODE,REG_NO,STUDENT_NAME,DEGREE_LEVEL,DEGREE_NAME,MARK,MARK_CODE
CS408,gds21131,Gabriel Weber,BSc (Hons),Computer Science,52,
CS408,xuj58904,Arthur Phillips,BSc (Hons),Computer Science,,EN
```

as well as:

```
INSERT INTO students (reg_no, student_name, year, degree_id) VALUES ('gds21131', 'Gabriel Weber', 1, 1);
INSERT INTO students (reg_no, student_name, year, degree_id) VALUES ('xuj58904', 'Arthur Phillips', 1, 1);
```

NOTE: This script requires the existence of a degree in the system (as the degree_id is hardcoded to 1). This is attainable by running the base values script present in the /backend/scripts folder.

## Usage

1. Initialize a virtual environment for packages (yes, a different one to the primary system!).

   ```
   [PowerShell]
   > python -m venv venv
   > venv/Scripts/activate

   [Bash]
   $ python -m venv venv
   $ source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Following that, you can run the application by simply running:

   ```
   python mark_generator.py
   ```

By running the data generation script as outlined above, a CSV file will be generated which includes 100 sample rows for the class `CS408`, however, this can be customised by running something in the format of `python mark_generator.py CLASS_CODE NUM_STUDENTS`, such as :

```
python mark_generator.py CS409 101
```

Which would generate 101 rows, for the class `CS409`. For more information, you can run `python mark_generator.py --help` which contains a list of arguments that can be passed in:

```
Usage: mark_generator.py [OPTIONS] [CLASS_CODE] [NUM_STUDENTS]

Arguments:
class_code        [CLASS_CODE]    [default: CS408]
num_students      [NUM_STUDENTS]  [default: 100]

Options:
--help          Show this message and exit.
```
