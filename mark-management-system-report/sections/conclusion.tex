\section{Conclusion}\label{conc}

The conclusion  is similar to when a plane lands.

Summarize main findings drawn from the project work. Mention the objectives or research questions. 
Do not repeat points raised in the discussion and reflection Section. If applicable, you can make recommendations. The conclusion should NOT contain any references.
