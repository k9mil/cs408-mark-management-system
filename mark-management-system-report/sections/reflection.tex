\section{Discussion \& Reflection}

\subsection{Interpreting the Results}

Here you will discuss your findings. This is especially relevant for research projects. You might 
 interpret what the data and evaluation implies, both for future research and for practice (if appropriate). 
 
 The discussion is \textbf{not} a review of literature. You should try to compare research findings with previous work,
provide  explanations for your findings,
discuss  research findings, in terms of their contribution.


\subsection{Reflection}

Look back and think about what you would do differently if you were going to start the project with the knowledge you have now. Be honest about your mistakes or missteps. 

\subsection{Challenges}
This is not the place to mention personal circumstances but rather challenges related to the work involved in the project.

\subsection{Limitations}
Acknowledge things like: small number of participants, software wasn't completely debugged, or whatever else went wrong and affected your project.
\emph{Include as appropriate}



\subsection{Future Work}
If someone else wanted to build on your project's product, what would be cool to do next?
