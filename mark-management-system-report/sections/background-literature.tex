\section{Background Literature}\label{backg}

This section should provide the grounding for your project. You will be able to refer back to this in Section \ref{process}, where you report on design decisions and methodology.

There should be a strong link to your research questions (for project types 2 and 3). There will be a strong link to the software design decisions for project type 1.

Don't just include a paragraph for each paper you read. Synthesize it and create a story line. 

Review between 5 and 10 authoritative sources. For research based projects, some of these should be from peer-reviewed journals or conferences. 

This section will reference literature like this \cite{turing1950computing}. Sloppy referencing will (1) take time and effort, and (2) lose you marks if you don't do it.
